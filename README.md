## Should you learn a framework?

Whether or not you need to learn a framework when starting with Go depends on your goals:

#### Learning the Basics:
If you're just getting started with Go, it might be beneficial to focus on learning the core language concepts and the Go standard library first. This will give you a solid foundation before diving into frameworks.
#### Building Simple Applications:
For simple command-line tools or small applications, you might not necessarily need a framework. The Go standard library can provide most of the functionality you'll need.
#### Building Web Applications: 
If you're interested in building web applications with Go, then learning a web framework like Gin or Echo can be very helpful. These frameworks will streamline the development process and provide essential features for web development.
